# Mandatory Requirements

## 1. Create a text box

<details>

  <summary>Crie uma caixa de texto com a qual quem usa pode interagir para inserir texto em cima da imagem escolhida.</summary><br/>

-   The box where the text is entered must have a`id`denominated`text-input`;

-   You must create an element to serve as_"container"_to the**Image**and for the**text**from the meme. This element must have a`id`denominated`meme-image-container`;

-   Inside the container element, you must create another element to display the typed text. The text element must be fully contained within the container and have the`id`denominated`meme-text`;

-   If there is no image inserted, it must be inserted and be visible inside the empty container where the image will appear.

    **What will be tested:**

-   The text input exists and we were able to input text into it;

-   The text typed in the input is visible on the screen;

-   There is a container element where the text will be displayed.

</details>

## 2. Create an image upload logic

<details>

  <summary>O site deve permitir que quem usa fa√ßa upload de uma imagem de seu computador.</summary><br/>

-   Inside the container element, you must create another element to display the selected image. This element must have a`id`denominated`meme-image`;

-   The element where the image is uploaded must be identified with the`id`denominated`meme-insert`. This element does not have to be inside the container element;

-   The image must be fully contained within the element identified as`meme-image-container`~~("fully contained" means that there should be no space left between the container and the image, and the image must not exceed the size of the container)~~;

-   The text inserted into the element`text-input`must be inserted over the chosen image`meme-image`.

    **What will be tested:**
